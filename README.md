# Triangle number cypher solver

The problem criteria is to find a concatenated string that resides along the right side of a triangle formed as follows
 
     1
    2 3
   4 5 6
  7 8 9 10 

Each one of these places is bijected to a string that contains the same number, in a list of strings of some unknown size, (as long as that size is a positive integer corresponding to a triangle number.)

For example!

Input:
6 house
1 mountain
3 shrewd
5 plato
9 cat
10 wendigo
2 blatant
4 present
7 games
8 north

Output:
mountain shrewd house wendigo
